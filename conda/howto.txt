The two txt versions (py2p - python 3.8, py2p_310 - python 3.10) were exported using the command
conda list --name <env-name> --export > <export_fname>.txt
This probably does not include packages installed by pip.

The two yml versions were exported using
conda env export > env_x.yml
These include the pip packages. Check their versions and manually install them if necessary.
